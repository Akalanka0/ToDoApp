This project was built to learn and experiment with:

- How Android Studio projects are structured
- How to build, run, and install APKs on Android devices
- How SMS sending works in Android
- How local databases (Room) work
- How AI tools like ChatGPT can assist in learning and development

---

## ✨ Features

- Add and delete simple tasks
- Store tasks locally using Room Database
- Basic task attributes (title, description, optional phone number)
- Send task details via SMS
